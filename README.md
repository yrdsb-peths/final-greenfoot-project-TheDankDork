A recreation of the popular and classical game - Spaceshooter!

Basic controls: 
  - WASD movement
  - Autofire

As you play, a total of 6 different meteors will spawn, faster and stronger progressively.  But as any balanced game has, there are a few ways to extend your run:
  - Destroy meteors to gain XP and level up!  Leveling up provides you with a stronger spaceship.
  - Collect powerups!  Some meteors carry powerups that will enhance your spaceship in different ways.
  - Use shields!  Only leaked meteors will cause damage to you.  You can immediately destroy the meteors by crashing into them (at the cost of shield, which can be regenerated through powerups).
  - More to be added...

Cheats
  - You can literally crash into bosses and instakill them (which will only clear your shield but not your health)
